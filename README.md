# topics
This project is a site created for having discussions about different topics.

## Website
The website for this is on [https://topicsapp.herokuapp.com](https://topicsapp.herokuapp.com) **however** the profile image system is done by *uploading* images, and since herokuapp's dyno loads a fresh version of the repository each time it starts, an uploaded image will disappear if someone later enters the website. For this reason I will eventually update the code to instead upload images to imgur (probably) and save it there instead of uploading it to the computer it's running on.
## Requests
You can make any pull requests since the code is surely not be perfect, as I am open to any improvement in the code.
### Purpose
The main purpose for the project was to attempt to improve in ASP.NET Core. Account information is stored with the MongoDB .NET Driver.
